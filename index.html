    <p>Hello, my name is Fabrizio Rodriguez. I'm from Venezuela, but I'm currently living in Brazil. I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ since I was 12 years old. Currently, I work at a T.I. company providing customer support. I would like to share my favorite scripture from the Book of Mormon: "Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy." (2 Nephi 9:51). I believe that if we strive to complete our courses, we will be following the example of the Savior to finish what we started.</p>
